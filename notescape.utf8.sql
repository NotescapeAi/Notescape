Passive information gathering (reconnaissance) involves collecting data without directly interacting with the target system, reducing the risk of detection. Gathering information from publicly available sources like news outlets, blogs and social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) is named as Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT). The techniques used for OSINT are Web Scraping, Google Dorking, and social media profiling. The tools that we have used for this in HO#2.2 were host, nslookup, dig, whois, knockpy, netdiscover, traceroute, whatweb, theHarvester, sherlock, wfw00f, Google Dorking, OSINT framework. Phase 2- Scanning and Vulnerability Analysis Scanning and vulnerability analysis is the second phase of penetration testing in which we scan the Network, ports, and OS services and determine if any of these are vulnerable. In cybersecurity, scanning and vulnerability analysis are closely related but differ in terms of purpose, depth, and focus. Scanning is broader and focuses on identifying what is present (systems, ports, services), while vulnerability analysis digs deeper to determine what is wrong with those systems (misconfigurations, unpatched software, exploitable flaws). ΓÇó Scanning: The objective of scanning is to identify systems, services and potential entry points in a network by performing port scanning, NW scanning and Services detection using tools like nmap, zenmap, unicorn, nikto and so on. Its primary focus is to map the target's environment and identify what is running and reachable. Unlike reconnaissance and information gathering, Scanning is Active information gathering, because the tools used in this phase directly interact with the target network, hosts, ports, employees, and so on to collect data. So DONOT perform active network scanning unless you have written permission of the system owner to perform that testing. The tools that we normally use for scanning are nmap, zenmap, unicornscan, nikto and so on. There can be different types of scanning like: o Network Scanning: Identifies live hosts, devices, and IP addresses within a network. o Port Scanning: Detects which ports are open and which services are running on those ports. o Service/OS Detection: Determines which operating systems and services are running on discovered hosts. Scanning results provide a list of systems, open ports, and running services. However, it doesnΓÇÖt necessarily reveal whether these are vulnerable or not. ΓÇó Vulnerability Analysis (or Vulnerability Assessment): The objective of vulnerability analysis is to dig deeper and perform an in-depth examination to uncover known vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the systems, applications, and their configurations. Its primary focus is to evaluate the specific risks associated with the discovered systems and services by doing an in-depth examination to uncover known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or weaknesses. The tools that we normally use for vulnerability analysis are nessus, searchsploit, OpenVAS, MSF, Burp-Suite, SQLMap and so on. The steps that we normally perform during vulnerability analysis are: o Scanning the target for known vulnerabilities using databases like CVE o Assessing the severity of discovered vulnerabilities

739	3feb65d6-df87-4cff-b54f-1b3a12f7af55	2	Instructor(s): Muhammad Rauf Butt, Muhammad Arif Butt, PhD \n3 Some Example of Famous CVEs ΓÇó CWE-120 (BoF): The program copies an input buffer to an output buffer without verifying that the size of the input buffer is less than the size of the output buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. o CVE-2017-0144 (Eternal Blue): A vulnerability in Microsoft SMBv1, that allows remote code execution, having a critical CVSS level. o CVE-2015-7547: A vulnerability pertains to stack based BoF in GNU glibcΓÇÖs getaddrinfo() function during DNS resolution. An attacker can exploit this by crafting malicious DNS responses, potentially leading to remote code execution or causing the application to crash. o CVE-2010-3904: A vulnerability in the reliable datagram sockets (RDS) protocol implementation within the Linux kernel versions prior to 2.6.36. Attacker with local access can gain elevated privileges, potentially obtaining root access. ΓÇó CWE-362 (Race Condition): The program contains a code sequence that can run concurrently with other code, and the code sequence requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence that is operating concurrently. o CVE-2016-5195 (Dirty COW): A vulnerability in Linux Kernel 2.x through 4.x before 4.8.3, that allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging incorrect handling of a copy-on-write feature to write to a read-only memory mapping, having a high CVSS level. ΓÇó CWE-78 (OS Command Injection): The program improperly sanitizes the user input before passing it to the operating system to execute as a shell command. o CVE-2014-6271 (Shellshock): A vulnerability in GNU bash shell version 1.03 to 4.3, that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by exploiting how bash shell processes environment variables. o CVE-2011-2523 (Backdoor): A vulnerability in vsftpd2.3.4, that opens a reverse shell at port 6200, and allows remote attackers to gain unauthorized root shell access. The attacker logs in It is assigned a critical CVSS level. ΓÇó CWE-281 (Improper preservations of permissions): This weakness occurs when an application or system fails to properly enforce or maintain permission settings, allowing unauthorized users to perform actions that should be restricted. o CVE-2019-14287 (sudo): A vulnerability in the program sudo versions prior to 1.8.28, using which an unprivileged user can gain root privileges by specifying -1 or 4294967295 as the user ID. It is assigned a critical CVSS level. ΓÇó CWE-843 (Type Confusion): The program allocates or initializes a resource such as a pointer, object, or variable using one type, but it later accesses that resource using a type that is incompatible with the original type. o CVE-2020-6418: A vulnerability in Google Chrome V8 JS engine, that exist in version 80.03987.122. o CVE-2021-21571: A vulnerability in MS EdgeΓÇÖs Chakra JS engine, that exist in version 91.0.864.36. ΓÇó H/W Based Vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-5715 (Spectre) and CVE-2017-5754 (Meltdown) exploit critical vulnerabilities in modern processors related with speculative execution and indirect branch prediction.

740	3feb65d6-df87-4cff-b54f-1b3a12f7af55	3	Instructor(s): Muhammad Rauf Butt, Muhammad Arif Butt, PhD \n4 Attack Vector An attack vector is the path way through which an attacker can exploit a vulnerability in a system, network or application to gain unauthorized access, steal data, deploy malware, or disrupt a service. There exist different types of attack vectors and I have categorized them into following classes: o Network-based attacks (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle, DoS/DDoS, ARP Spoofing) o Web-based attacks (e.g., SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting, CSRF) o System-based attacks (e.g., Buffer Overflow, Privilege Escalation, Rootkits) o Social Engineering attacks (e.g., Phishing, Pretexting, Baiting) o Malware-based attacks (e.g., Ransomware, Trojans, Worms, Keyloggers) o Physical attacks (e.g., USB-based attacks, Evil Maid Attacks) Attack Vector Description Famous CVE Example Example Scenario Remote Code Execution (RCE) Allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on a target system remotely. CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) Used by WannaCry ransomware, exploiting SMBv1 in Windows to spread across networks. Command Injection Injecting malicious commands into an application that executes system commands. CVE-2011-2523 (Backdoor) The attacker logs in with a specially crafted username ending with ΓÇ£:)ΓÇ¥ and password anything to activate the hidden backdoor Privilege Escalation Attackers gain higher privileges on a system (e.g., from user to root). CVE-2016-5195 (Dirty COW) Linux vulnerability allowing users to gain root privileges by modifying read-only files. Remote Desktop Exploit Exploiting vulnerabilities in RDP services to gain control over systems. CVE-2019-0708 (BlueKeep) Affects older versions of Windows RDP, allowing attackers to execute code remotely without authentication. Memory Corruption Attacker manipulates memory structures to control a system. CVE-2004-0597 (JPEG GDI+ Overflow) Windows systems were exploited by maliciously crafted JPEG images causing buffer overflows. Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) Attackers overload a system, making it unavailable. CVE-2013-5211 (NTP Amplification Attack) Attackers exploited the monlist command in NTP servers to launch large-scale DDoS attacks. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attackers intercept or alter communication between two parties. CVE-2020-0601 (CurveBall) Attackers forged cryptographic certificates to impersonate trusted websites. SQL Injection (SQLi) Injecting malicious SQL queries to manipulate databases. CVE-2012-1823 (PHP CGI SQLi) Attackers gained remote access to web servers by manipulating PHP CGI parameters. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Injecting malicious scripts into a web page viewed by users. CVE-2014-0160 (Heartbleed) Although primarily an OpenSSL memory leak, attackers used it to steal session tokens and conduct XSS attacks. Brute Force Attack Repeatedly guessing credentials to gain unauthorized access. CVE-2018-15473 (OpenSSH User Enumeration) Allowed attackers to determine valid SSH usernames by analyzing server responses. Exploit in Cryptographic Libraries Weaknesses in cryptographic implementations that lead to vulnerabilities. CVE-2014-0160 (Heartbleed) OpenSSL flaw allowed attackers to leak sensitive information from memory. Browser Exploits Exploiting vulnerabilities in web browsers to execute malicious code. CVE-2019-5786 (Chrome Zero-Day) Used in the wild to escape ChromeΓÇÖs sandbox and gain higher privileges. Malware Delivery via SMB Protocol Exploiting vulnerabilities in SMB to spread malware. CVE-2017-0144 (EternalBlue) Used by NotPetya and WannaCry ransomware to spread laterally across networks.

It sends various probes (like ICMP echo request, TCP SYN to port 443, or ICMP timestamp request) to check if the target is up. By default, it wonΓÇÖt scan any ports, only determining whether the host is active. In older versions of Nmap (before version 4.0), -sp was used to perform a ping scan. However, in recent versions, it has been deprecated in favour of -sn option. $ nmap ΓÇôsn 10.0.2.0/24 \n TCP SYN Scan TCP SYN scan, often referred to as a "half-open" scan, is one of the most common and efficient scanning techniques used by nmap. It works by sending SYN packets to the target ports and analysing the responses. This type of scan is called "half-open" because it does not complete the full TCP handshake. HereΓÇÖs how it works: $ sudo nmap ΓÇôsS <ip of M2> ΓÇó SYN Packet Sent: nmap sends a SYN packet to the target port. ΓÇó Response Analysis: o SYN/ACK Received: If the target port is open, it responds with a SYN/ACK packet. Instead of ACK, Nmap sends an RST (reset) packet to terminate the connection before the handshake completes, which prevents the connection from being logged. o RST Received: If the target port is closed, it responds with an RST packet. o No Response/Filtered: If there is no response or if a packet filtering device (like a firewall) is present, the port is marked as filtered. TCP Connect Scan A TCP Connect scan perform full 3-way handshake and so do not require root privileges. It is easily detected. By the target machine administrator as it leaves quite a bit of foot print. This is the default nmap scan, i.e., if you do not use any option the scan that is performed is TCP connect scan. TCP Scan works in the following way: $ nmap ΓÇôsT <ip of M2> ΓÇó SYN Packet Sent: Nmap sends a SYN packet to the target port. ΓÇó SYN/ACK Received: If the target port is open, it responds with a SYN/ACK packet. ΓÇó ACK Sent: Nmap sends an ACK packet to complete the TCP three-way handshake, establishing a connection. ΓÇó RST Packet Sent: Immediately after establishing the connection, Nmap sends an RST (reset) packet to close the

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) is a specific instance of a vulnerability in a version of a real-world application that can be exploited [CVE-YYYY-NNNNN]. The primary maintainer of CWE and CVE databases, who develops, updates and publishes their entries is MITRE (MIT Research and Engineering). For details visit: https://cwe.mitre.org, https://cve.mitre.org, https://cve.org, https://cvedetails.com, https://nvd.nist.gov/ , https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/categories and https://openwasp.org/ CVSS Common Vulnerability Scoring System is a standardized framework used to assess and communicate the severity of vulnerabilities in software and hardware systems based on factors such as exploitability, impact, and complexity. CVSS provides a numeric score (ranging from 0 to 10) along with a severity level rating to help organizations prioritize their responses to vulnerabilities. ΓÇó Critical (9.0 ΓÇô 10.0): Vulnerabilities that are extremely easy to exploit and lead to complete compromise of systems or data. ΓÇó High (7.0 ΓÇô 8.9): Vulnerabilities are easily exploitable and have a significant impact on confidentiality, integrity, or availability. ΓÇó Medium (4.0 ΓÇô 6.9): Vulnerabilities that can be exploited but typically require some conditions, and the impact is moderate. ΓÇó Low (0.1 ΓÇô 3.9): Vulnerabilities that have limited impact or require complex conditions to exploit. ΓÇó None (0.0): No impact or exploitation potential. An example is CVE-2015-1235 (Google Chrome Crash) has a CVSS score of 0.0. It is a vulnerability in Google Chrome that allowed attackers to cause a browser crash via a crafted web page. However, no code execution or data compromise was possible, leading to its 0.0 score. CVE Process ΓÇó Discovery: A vulnerability or exposure is discovered by a security researcher, vendor, or another entity. ΓÇó Reporting: The issue is reported to a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) or directly to MITRE. CNAs are organizations authorized to assign CVE IDs and manage CVE entries for their respective domains.

Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. Simply speaking, we can use nmap for network scanning, port scanning, and vulnerability scanning. Some of the most useful tasks that nmap can perform, are mentioned below: ΓÇó Host Discovery: Identifying live hosts on a network. This can be done using various techniques such as ICMP echo requests, TCP/UDP packets, and ARP requests. ΓÇó Port Scanning: Determining which ports on a target are open, closed, or filtered. Different types of scans include SYN scan, TCP connect scan, UDP scan, and FIN scan. ΓÇó Service Version Detection: Identifying the versions of services running on open ports. This helps in determining specific software vulnerabilities. ΓÇó Operating System Detection: Fingerprinting the target's operating system and sometimes even determining the OS version and device type. ΓÇó Scriptable Interaction: Using Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) to perform advanced network tasks such as vulnerability detection, backdoor detection, and more. NSE scripts can also be customized or created to meet specific needs. ΓÇó Stealth Scanning: Performing scans in a way that minimizes detection by firewalls and intrusion detection systems (IDS). Basic Usage of nmap $ nmap --version $ nmap ΓÇôh $ man nmap $ nmap <IP/hostname/NW Addr> \n Command Description $ nmap 192.168.1.1 Scanning a single IP (By default nmap scans first 1000 commonly used ports) $ nmap www.domain.com Scanning a hostname $ nmap 192.168.1.1-100 Scanning an IP range $ nmap 192.168.1.1/24 Scanning an entire subnet $ nmap -iL list.txt Scanning from a predefined list Command

ΓÇó Closed: This indicates that the port is reachable but not currently in use, i.e., no application is listening on it. ΓÇó Filtered: Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open because packet filtering prevents its probes from reaching the port. This is often due to a firewall or other NW security devices. ΓÇó Unfiltered: The port is accessible, but Nmap cannot determine if it is open or closed. ΓÇó Open|Filtered: Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open or filtered. This happens when Nmap does not receive enough information to decide between the two states. ΓÇó Closed|Filtered: Nmap cannot determine whether the port is closed or filtered. This is a less common state, indicating ambiguous results. Scanning the Famous http://scanme.nmap.org This is a machine that nmap has setup for the folks to test and make sure that their Nmap installation (or Internet connection) is working properly.

Different operating systems and versions have distinct ways of responding to network probes. By sending probes to both open and closed ports, nmap can gather more varied responses. We can perform OS detection using the -O option to nmap: $ sudo nmap ΓÇôO <ip of M2> The highlighted output in red tells us about the running Linux kernel. The X in version numbers like 2.6.X signifies that nmap has identified the major and minor version of the OS but does not have enough information to determine the exact patch level or sub-version. This shows that nmap scans are not all accurate or give complete information.

The connections are scanned using a 3-way handshake. The 3-way handshake is a fundamental process used in the TCP/IP protocol suite to establish a reliable connection between a client and a server. It ensures that both parties are ready to communicate and can establish a connection with synchronized parameters. Steps in a handshake are mentioned below: \n \n ΓÇó SYN (Synchronize): o The client initiates the connection by sending a TCP segment with the SYN (synchronize) flag set to the server. This segment includes an initial sequence number (ISN), which is a random value used to synchronize the sequence numbers between the client and the server. ΓÇó SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge): o The server responds to the client's SYN segment with a TCP segment that has both the SYN and ACK (acknowledge) flags set. The server's segment also includes its own initial sequence number (SYN) and acknowledges the client's SYN by setting the ACK number to the clientΓÇÖs ISN + 1. ΓÇó ACK (Acknowledge): o The client sends a final acknowledgment (ACK) to the server. This segment acknowledges the server's SYN by setting the acknowledgment number to the serverΓÇÖs ISN + 1. o At this point, the connection is established, and both parties are ready to exchange data. The ports on both client and server side are now in established

Unlike TCP, UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is connectionless, which makes it more challenging to scan. However, it is crucial for identifying services that run over UDP, such as DNS (53), DHCP(67), and TFTP (69) and SNMP. $ nmap ΓÇôsU <ip of M2> ΓÇó UDP Packet Sent: Nmap sends a UDP packet to the target port. The default payload for the UDP packet is empty, but Nmap can use more specific probes for well-known services. ΓÇó Response Analysis: o No Response: If there is no response, the port is assumed to be open or filtered. Many UDP services do not respond unless they receive a valid request, which can make definitive detection challenging. o ICMP Port Unreachable: If the target sends back an ICMP Port Unreachable message (Type 3, Code 3), the port is closed. o Other ICMP Responses: Different ICMP responses may indicate that the port is filtered or unreachable for other reasons. Retries: Nmap may send multiple probes and use different payloads to increase accuracy. This is because UDP scanning is prone to packet loss and other issues that can cause false positives or negatives. Finding Versions of Services To tell nmap to display the version of different services running on different ports we can use the -sV option. Remember for this to work we need to be root or in the sudoer file. $ sudo nmap ΓÇôsV <ip of M2> \n As we can see along with services, we can now also see the version of each service. We can see that nmap has failed to find the versions of some of the services. This can be solved by --version-intensity that allows you to control the aggressiveness or intensity of version detection when scanning target services.

We can specify a level of intensity from 0 to 9: ΓÇó 0: Disable version detection. ΓÇó 1-4: Low to moderate intensity, suitable for quick scans with less detailed version information. ΓÇó 5 (default): Balanced intensity, providing a good compromise between speed and accuracy. ΓÇó 6-9: Higher intensity levels, which increase the accuracy of version detection but might take longer and be more intrusive. Evading Firewalls/IDS using nmap A Firewall is a NW security device or software that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. The two main types are Network firewall that protects an entire network by filtering traffic at the network level and Host-based firewall that protects individual devices (like computers or servers) by filtering traffic at the operating system or application level. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS), on the other hand is a security tool that monitors network or system activities for malicious or suspicious activities and alerts administrators or takes automated actions in response. The two main types are Network-based IDS (NIDS) that monitors network traffic in real-time, analysing packets and patterns to detect suspicious activities across the network and Host-based IDS (HIDS) that runs on individual devices or hosts, monitoring activities. Firewalls are unpredictable as we donΓÇÖt know the rules applied to the firewall. So, we donΓÇÖt know what kind of scan to perform. The -f option in nmap is used to fragment packets. This means nmap splits the probes into smaller IP fragments rather than sending them as one complete packet. The goal of using packet fragmentation is to evade detection by firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) that may be set up to detect and block standard nmap scanning patterns. $ nmap ΓÇôf 10.0.2.4 // splits packets into 8-bytes fragments $ nmap ΓÇôf ΓÇôf 10.0.2.4 // splits packets into 16-bytes fragments $ nmap ΓÇômtu 32 10.0.2.4 // specify the exact size of packets Decoy Scanning The -D option in nmap is used to perform decoy scanning, which helps to obscure the true source of the scan by making it appear as if multiple hosts (decoys) are scanning the target. This technique can be useful for evading detection and confusing firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and intrusion prevention systems (IPS). $ nmap ΓÇôD RND:5 10.0.2.4 The above command will make 5 random decoys and will scan the target machine along with the original source machine. Using Proxies to Redirect your Nmap Scans In our previous handout we have already seen and understood different techniques like proxies and Tor browser to anonymize our traffic on the Internet. Following command will use proxy chains to redirect our nmap scans in order to mask our original IP address: $ proxychains nmap -F

These scripts are used to perform more detailed scanning and automate a wide range of tasks, from vulnerability detection to network auditing. These scripts can automate various network tasks, perform complex network reconnaissance, vulnerability detection, exploitation, and more. On Linux machine, these scripts are located at /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ directory containing over 600 different scripts with each script belonging to a specific category. Visit this directory to check out the available scripts on your Kali Linux machine and practice running different scripts on Metasploitable2 machine. ΓÇó Check out what a specific script does: Some scripts are very noisy, some not at all. So, it is important to read what each script does and if it is easily detectable by the target or not. Let us check what ftp-anon.nse script do by using the ΓÇô-script-help option of nmap as shown below: $ nmap ΓÇô-script-help ftp-anon.nse ΓÇó Running single script: We can run single script of our choice using the following command: $ nmap ΓÇô-script ftp-anon.nse <IP of M2> \n From the output of above command, we see that Metasploitable2 has anonymous FTP vulnerability, i.e., it allows to login using anonymous username and blank password.

For example, ftp-anon.nse script attempts to guess FTP login credentials o brute: These scripts use brute force attacks to guess authentication credentials of a remote server. Nmap contains scripts for brute forcing dozens of protocols, including http-brute-nse, oracle-brute.nse, snmp-brute.nse and so on. o malware: These scripts test whether the target platform is infected by malware or backdoors. An example script in this category is smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse that checks for the MS17-010 vulnerability exploited by WannaCry. o vuln: These scripts check for specific known vulnerabilities and generally only report results if they are found. Examples include realvnc-auth-bypass and afp-path-vuln. o exploit: These scripts exploit vulnerabilities to confirm their existence. An example script in this category is http-sql-injection.nse that checks for the SQL injection vulnerabilities. Other example include http-shellshock.nse o default: These scripts are the default, and are run using using ΓÇô-script default or using simply the -A option.

751	3feb65d6-df87-4cff-b54f-1b3a12f7af55	14	Instructor(s): Muhammad Rauf Butt, Muhammad Arif Butt, PhD \n15 Searchsploit We have already seen that we can use the nmap -sV option to check for the versions of different services along with their state and port numbers as shown in the following screenshot. \n Now a $100 question is how can we find out, which out of these services has some vulnerability without using any tool. One way is open a browser and type the `service name` followed by `exploit` keyword and press enter (e.g., ΓÇ£vsftpd 2.3.4 exploitΓÇ¥ or ΓÇ£Appache httpd 2.2.8 exploitΓÇ¥). Visit some links and try to find whether these are vulnerable applications, and if yes try finding exploits for these vulnerable applications. Do visit https://www.cve.org/ The searchsploit is a Linux command-line search tool to search the Exploit Database (EDB), while staying offline. It is used to search for known vulnerabilities and exploits related to hardware, software, operating systems, web applications, and configurations. These exploits are already indexed in the Exploit Database. It allows you to quickly find exploits based on various criteria like software names, CVE identifiers, or platform types. The most common use cases of searchsploit are: Installing and using searchsploit: ΓÇó An easy way to install exploitdb and use searchsploit on your Kali Linux machine use following command: $ sudo apt-get install exploitdb ΓÇó You can also install from source, available at https://gitlab.com/exploit-database/exploitdb ΓÇó Do check out /usr/share/exploitdb directory for available exploits and shellcodes for different OSs and different architectures. ΓÇó Before you start using the tool, you must update the Exploit Database (EDB), using the following command: $ searchsploit

To searchsploit, we just need to give the name of the service along with its version, and it searches in the local Kali Linux exploitdb directory for all the exploits that Kali Linux has and tries to find an exploit that will work for that specific version. $ searchsploit vsftpd 2.3.4 From the output of the above command, you can see that it also suffers with the Backdoor Command Execution vulnerability and we have two exploits for it one written in Python and other in Ruby. To check the absolute path of these exploits, we can use the locate command: $ locate 49757.py /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/unix/remote/49757.py ΓÇó Let us now try to find out if UnrealIRCd (Internet

But remember, searchsploit uses an AND operator, not an OR operator. The more terms that are used, the more results will be filtered out: $ searchsploit afd windows local o Title Searching: By default, searchsploit will check BOTH the title of the exploit as well as the path.

754	3feb65d6-df87-4cff-b54f-1b3a12f7af55	17	Instructor(s): Muhammad Rauf Butt, Muhammad Arif Butt, PhD \n18 Nessus Nessus is a platform developed by Tenable that scans for security vulnerabilities in devices, applications, operating systems, cloud services and other network resources. Unlike nmap, it checks for specific vulnerabilities tied to known CVEs along with their CVSS scores. The Professional version has a cost to pay, so we will install and use the free Nessus Essentials version, which can work only in a Local Area Network and cannot perform a scan on a machine/website on the Internet. Moreover, with Nessus Essentials version, we can scan up to 16 IP addresses within a LAN. Some common features of Nessus are: ΓÇó Vulnerability scanning: Nessus scans servers for known vulnerabilities. For example, detecting outdated software versions that may be suspectable to exploits. ΓÇó Credential-based scanning: Authenticated scans with login credentials provide Nessus deeper access, enhancing the accuracy of vulnerability detection. ΓÇó Web Application scanning: It identifies the vulnerabilities in web applications such as SQL injection or XSS flaws. ΓÇó Malware detection: Nessus identifies the potential malware indicators by analyzing the system files and configuration. Downloading, Installing and Configuring Nessus on Kali Machine: ΓÇó Open your browser and search for download nessus. Use the Tenable link and download the latest version of Nessus for your platform, i.e., Linux-Debian-amd64, which will download the Nessus-10.8.2-debian10_amd64.deb file. ΓÇó Now to install it use the following command: $ sudo dpkg -i Nessus-10.8.2-debian10_amd64.deb ΓÇó After installation is done, you need to start and check status of the service: $ sudo systemctl start nessusd.service $ systemctl status nessusd.service ΓÇó In order to configure the Nessus Essential (free version), you need to go to https://kali:8834 link inside your browser. Perform the steps and finally it will initialize and download all required plugins. This may take a bit of time depending on your Internet speed.

It is designed to identify security vulnerabilities in networked systems and services, providing comprehensive reporting and remediation guidance. OpenVAS is widely used by security professionals for vulnerability assessment, compliance auditing, and network security monitoring. Installing and Running OpenVAS Installing OpenVAS on Kali Linux is the fastest and recommended way. On other distributions OpenVAS needs to be compiled from source, that is error prone and cumbersome. On Kali Linux you can install OpenVAS with the following commands: $ sudo apt install gvm ΓÇôy $ sudo apt install openvas ΓÇôy $ sudo gvm-setup // This will do automatic OpenVAS configuration Note: A password will be printed on the screen.

This means that these pages cannot be found through standard search queries. Scope: ΓÇó Size: The deep web is estimated to be significantly larger than the surface web, possibly hundreds of times greater in terms of data and content. ΓÇó Content: Includes private databases, academic and scientific research, medical records, legal documents, financial records, and internal organizational sites. It also encompasses online banking, subscription-only websites, and any other content that requires authentication or is behind a paywall. Accessibility: ΓÇó Access: Accessible to anyone with the correct URL and permissions. For example, accessing your email, logging into your online banking account, or reading a private academic journal all involve entering the deep web. ΓÇó Purpose: Provides a means for secure, private information exchange and storage. It is used by individuals, businesses, and governments to protect sensitive information and ensure privacy. Examples: ΓÇó Academic databases like JSTOR or IEEE Xplore. ΓÇó Government databases and resources not intended for public access. ΓÇó Corporate intranets and internal systems. The Dark Web Definition: The dark web is a small portion of the deep web that has been intentionally hidden and is inaccessible through standard web browsers. It requires specific software, configurations, or authorization to access. Scope: ΓÇó Size: A much smaller subset of the deep web, but it is the most notorious due to its association with illegal activities. ΓÇó Content: Includes marketplaces for illicit goods and services (such as drugs, weapons, and stolen data), forums for criminal activity, and other illegal content. However, it also hosts sites for whistleblowing, political activism, and secure communication. Accessibility: ΓÇó Access: Requires special software like Tor (The Onion Router) or I2P (Invisible Internet Project) to access. These tools anonymize user activity by routing traffic through multiple nodes. ΓÇó Purpose: Provides a platform for anonymous communication and transactions. It is used by those seeking privacy and anonymity, such as political activists, journalists, and individuals living under oppressive regimes. It is also exploited by criminals for illicit activities. Examples: ΓÇó Marketplaces: Silk Road (defunct), AlphaBay (defunct), and others that emerge frequently.

Ethical hackers use their skills to improve the security of these systems by identifying weaknesses and recommending corrective measures. The primary goal of ethical hacking is to ensure the security and integrity of information systems. A hacker is someone skilled in computer systems and programming who uses his expertise to explore, understand, and manipulate technology. Hackers can be categorized based on their intentions and the legality of their actions: ΓÇó White-Hat Hackers (Ethical Hackers): o Intentions: Positive, with the aim of improving security. o Activities: Conduct authorized penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and security audits. o Example: Security professionals who work for companies to secure their networks. ΓÇó Black-Hat Hackers (Malicious Hackers): o Intentions: Malicious, often motivated by personal gain, causing harm, or disrupting systems. o Activities: Unauthorized access to systems, data theft, malware distribution, and other illegal activities. o Example: Cybercriminals who steal credit card information or deploy ransomware. ΓÇó Gray-Hat Hackers: o Intentions: Ambiguous; they may break into systems without permission but without malicious intent. o Activities: Often exploit vulnerabilities and then inform the system owner, sometimes expecting a reward. o Example: Hackers who find and disclose vulnerabilities in software without explicit permission but without harmful intent. Vulnerability, Exploit, and Payload ΓÇó A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw that can exist in a hardwareΓÇÖs firmware, in the OS of computer or router, NW services, libraries and application software that can be exploited by a threat actor to gain unauthorized access, cause damage, or perform unauthorized actions. A common example of a real-life vulnerability is a house with a weak lock on main door. ΓÇó An exploit is a program/software that take advantage of a vulnerability leading to gain initial access or privilege escalation on the target. A common example of a real-life exploit is the duplicate key using which a robber can enter the house. ΓÇó A payload is the malicious code which runs on the compromised system after initial access, enabling actions like remote control, data exfiltration, or persistence. It can be active (a reverse shell that maintains a live connection) or passive (a keylogger that silently records keystrokes). A common example of a real-life payload is the robber stealing jewellery or cash from the compromised house. Example: Consider a refrigerator with an electronic lock contains chocolates, fruit trifle, cold drinks etc. Somehow you come to know about its vulnerability that it can be unlocked using a PAK123 key, written on the door. You exploit that vulnerability and open/unlock the refrigerator. So, an exploit is a code that takes advantage of a vulnerability, while a payload is the code executed on the target machine once the exploit is successful.	3292	1	1	[-0.003566686,0.0459609,-0.06399824,-0.020483756,-0.020711234,-0.05492742,0.0461216,-0.05414633,0.02723345,0.024615563,-0.010316533,0.013040703,0.08849928,-0.024847552,-0.05668988,0.0054815067,-0.052994724,0.0012977164,-0.057974823,0.00788988,-0.013426695,-0.057209447,0.0023566766,-0.053399887,-0.105092905,-0.020884769,0.058995564,-0.04554949,-0.08331987,0.033514693,-0.045699947,-0.00045014662,0.054988656,0.09601548,-0.051454052,-0.055815708,0.050499104,0.009224505,-0.020971736,-0.010977796,-0.07332724,-0.011079926,0.005614218,0.014514281,-0.0448767,-0.017501913,0.028033597,-0.046420977,-0.048189618,-0.050078526,-0.045197576,0.0063874223,0.011564803,0.046424076,-0.02226422,-0.095190756,0.08165167,0.0011566948,0.04112316,0.012350163,0.03976186,0.04033661,0.012396819,0.020298272,0.020122165,0.03843106,-0.016209103,0.022024503,-0.022194924,0.031560693,-0.034739997,-0.06870248,-0.015454437,0.028418869,0.07646859,0.004148656,-0.0024916267,0.021284312,0.028559577,-0.052627377,0.06240183,0.052747823,-0.03320155,0.069484964,-0.02448374,0.061479572,-0.04555612,-0.023421243,0.11393856,0.010747055,-0.00023337286,0.019180482,0.04433318,-0.0061240047,0.09161318,-0.07374769,0.0860294,-0.033849362,-0.029574426,0.020665154,-0.055741817,-0.004968589,-0.0049213534,-0.075343765,0.021146059,0.056309197,0.009899611,-0.015724408,0.019685572,-0.0034553588,-0.020546146,0.071055055,-0.069313616,-0.07770229,0.111283205,-0.007032835,-0.058139775,0.11073628,-0.0023218216,0.046246365,0.04254923,0.05507961,0.03049545,-0.015235673,0.038953356,-0.099138476,-0.10058414,2.8909934e-33,-0.036779717,0.06617228,-0.020302767,0.026526686,0.01871703,-0.020875959,0.008116025,0.06741112,-0.027555,0.10593958,0.013580375,0.05631387,0.05466413,0.07669241,0.11354888,0.08837158,0.01489138,-0.03800508,-0.0324497,0.007647873,0.089204706,-0.09205678,0.05257345,-0.015374698,0.013227552,-0.06920163,-0.07153423,-0.03937789,0.05290337,0.024621727,0.009017605,0.007817841,-0.02333897,-0.023202332,0.015457279,0.031876825,0.025703758,-0.050295208,-0.02804648,0.0075067324,-0.061039194,-0.009786144,0.05054109,-0.00054059934,0.051930018,-0.011518698,-0.017921612,-0.032176126,0.03514838,0.01387166,-0.04682109,0.0052266945,0.10283255,-0.0009468895,-0.035852943,-0.016485408,0.0452709,-0.07376105,-0.013911538,0.113982335,0.015378753,0.006929429,-0.07472207,-0.026800836,-0.04208332,-0.090198785,0.07845739,0.026586253,0.043384586,0.027136281,-0.028052064,-0.029280934,-0.058079824,0.022122536,-0.10558092,0.019845491,0.007822415,0.050439212,0.04806673,0.045792066,-0.04007529,-0.040807057,0.01287556,-0.049964353,-0.0709895,0.031162405,-0.08428927,-0.021611707,0.016337048,0.058545318,-0.011918713,-0.004803181,-0.022716645,0.061081674,-0.04037722,-6.512616e-33,-0.08910591,0.015328294,-0.08614376,0.06309079,0.05750932,-0.00505734,-0.0059186276,-0.023302326,0.0034530524,0.006980751,-0.114322186,-0.04193494,0.018780714,-0.06013021,0.08774569,-0.04710535,-0.05534681,0.0570457,-0.113281794,0.059044383,0.01800787,0.08700703,-0.060862496,-0.116252884,0.025516529,-0.0022118797,0.035506006,0.03481548,0.014246336,0.11411981,0.041688357,0.101765655,-0.020920262,0.08296267,-0.010616227,0.043929886,0.092730455,-0.03247619,-0.024365747,0.00014451948,0.044348788,0.09557672,-0.019514613,-0.029381627,-0.01126473,0.010972835,-0.07974152,0.08924376,0.04334943,-0.058404576,0.09518708,-0.017128231,0.061382316,0.006685294,0.03774084,0.0023478658,-0.055439927,-0.033664033,0.09435086,0.03727851,0.03154287,-0.020429239,-0.007371821,0.11486194,-0.084359966,-0.0073089404,-0.006513094,0.06280074,-0.074416175,-0.079523325,0.049897112,-0.051232334,-0.061108008,-0.052439813,-0.05681847,-0.04605448,-0.09678402,-0.046382293,-0.07375086,0.05137972,0.086435795,-0.06796967,-0.02611735,0.038319834,-0.068987966,-0.0037412639,0.07332766,0.033488333,0.025942443,-0.09548998,-0.068080276,-0.055660166,-0.110942386,0.03935724,0.031192422,-5.9324183e-08,-0.007291666,-0.026329616,0.024074044,0.025669662,0.0016043178,0.06440286,-0.102037534,-0.078527406,-0.018430129,0.0154811125,0.032422185,-0.039573308,-0.06442877,-0.049861398,0.016072748,0.016931174,-0.045834266,-0.024201427,-0.002881565,0.05439509,0.0077207736,-0.021004481,-0.059108764,0.020430865,0.008954302,-0.05577313,-0.035391897,0.020281691,0.036154777,0.043427926,-0.049780935,-0.012460319,0.0029980713,-0.027585281,-0.095578596,0.023480939,-0.06478821,-0.057704754,0.05750403,0.042795375,-0.09450492,-0.040870946,0.06575966,0.0028524941,-0.09504168,-0.026018238,-0.06349897,0.012610817,0.011679297,-0.041894693,0.030678159,-0.06120808,-0.0042261262,0.07317905,-0.0038808016,-0.015873672,0.0050199707,-0.0058182483,-0.025703643,0.06537294,0.06643738,0.009144915,0.016035948,-0.07175065,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Addressing them typically involves regular patching, configuring secure settings, and using robust security controls. ΓÇó Kernel Vulnerabilities: Flaws in the OS kernel, the core part of the OS, that attackers can exploit to gain root access. May result in a full system compromise. ΓÇó Buffer Overflow: Occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, leading to memory corruption. It can be exploited to execute arbitrary code or crash the system. ΓÇó Insecure APIs: Vulnerabilities in application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow attackers to interact with the OS in unintended ways. Data breaches or system manipulation. ΓÇó Race Conditions: Timing vulnerabilities where two processes try to change the same resource at the same time. Can lead to data corruption or unauthorized access. ΓÇó Unpatched Software: Failure to apply security patches to the OS or applications. It allows attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities. ΓÇó Weak Access Controls: Poorly configured permissions, allowing unauthorized users access to sensitive system resources. Unauthorized access, data leakage, or system compromise. ΓÇó Malware Infection: Malware can exploit OS vulnerabilities to install backdoors, keyloggers, ransomware, or spyware. It can result in system compromise, data theft, or denial of service. ΓÇó Directory Traversal: An attacker gains access to restricted directories and files outside a web server's root directory by manipulating file paths. Access to sensitive files like password databases. ΓÇó Default Configurations: OS installations with default settings can expose unnecessary services or weak security configurations. Increases the attack surface. ΓÇó Outdated Cryptography: Using outdated or weak cryptographic algorithms for data protection. Enables attackers to decrypt sensitive information. ΓÇó Command Injection: An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands by exploiting input validation flaws in the OS. System compromise and data theft.

This concept is often associated with privacy and security measures designed to protect an individual's identity and activities from being discovered or tracked by others, including service providers, other users, and malicious entities. Connecting to the Internet can be done in various ways, each offering different levels of privacy, security, and complexity. HereΓÇÖs a detailed explanation of each approach: 1. Directly Connected via LAN \n Description: Connecting directly to the Internet through a Local Area Network (LAN) typically involves using an Ethernet cable or a Wi-Fi connection provided by a router. This is the most common method for home and office environments. Pros: ΓÇó Simplicity: Easy to set up and use with minimal configuration required. ΓÇó Speed: Generally, offers high-speed Internet access, depending on the quality of the ISP and network infrastructure. ΓÇó Stability: Provides a stable connection with low latency. Cons: ΓÇó Lack of Privacy: Using a browser like Google chrome provides almost no privacy or anonymity at all. These browsers and many other applications using which you access the Internet collect your private data in order to show you personalized ads. Similarly, when doing penetration testing, e.g., doing a nmap scan of a network, your IP address and other information is exposed to the target machine running websites and online services and therefore making it easy to track you and log your activities. ΓÇó Security Risks: Without additional security measures, such as a firewall or antivirus software, the system may be vulnerable to attacks.

Use a Proxy Server Description: A proxy server acts as an intermediary between the userΓÇÖs device and the Internet. When you connect to a website using a proxy, the website only sees the IP address of the proxy server, thus providing some level of anonymity. Links for some free proxy services that you can use are given below: ΓÇó https://hideme.com/lander ΓÇó https://www.proxfree.com/ Pros: ΓÇó Anonymity: Hides the userΓÇÖs IP address, making it harder to track online activities. ΓÇó Access Control: Can be used to bypass geo-restrictions and access blocked content. ΓÇó Content Filtering: Often used in organizations to monitor and control employee Internet usage. Cons: ΓÇó No Encryption: Many proxies do not encrypt traffic, leaving it vulnerable to interception. ΓÇó Logging: Proxy servers can log user activity, potentially compromising privacy. ΓÇó Performance: Can introduce latency, slowing down Internet speed. 3. Use Multiple Proxies Description: Using multiple proxies means manually switching between different proxy servers for each session or connection. You are not routing your traffic through several proxies in a sequence for the same connection, but rather using one proxy at a time and changing it for each new request or session. Pros: ΓÇó Increased Anonymity: Enhanced privacy compared to a single proxy by adding more layers of obfuscation. ΓÇó Bypassing Censorship: Makes it harder for authorities or attackers to block or track Internet access. Cons: ΓÇó Complex Setup: Configuring and maintaining multiple proxies can be complex. ΓÇó Performance Degradation: Increased latency due to multiple hops, potentially slowing down the connection significantly. ΓÇó Reliability Issues: If one proxy in the chain fails, it can disrupt the entire

ΓÇó Authentication & Session Management Vulnerabilities: These vulnerabilities allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users or hijack user sessions. o Broken Authentication: Weaknesses in login mechanisms that allow attackers to bypass authentication. o Session Hijacking: Stealing or predicting session tokens to impersonate a user. o Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF/XSRF): Trick a user into submitting a request they did not intend, potentially altering user data. o Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): Manipulating URL parameters to access data or resources without proper authorization. ΓÇó Input Validation Vulnerabilities: These vulnerabilities arise when user input is not properly validated, allowing attackers to submit unexpected or malicious data. o Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Where user input is not sanitized, allowing malicious scripts to be executed in other users' browsers. o HTML Injection: Injecting raw HTML into a page, which can manipulate the website's appearance or behaviour. o File Upload Vulnerabilities: Uploading malicious files (e.g., scripts or executables) to the server. o Remote File Inclusion (RFI): Loading remote files into the web application, leading to arbitrary code execution. ΓÇó Access Control Vulnerabilities: These are weaknesses in enforcing proper access levels, allowing users to access resources they shouldn't. o Broken Access Control: Insufficient restriction on what authenticated users can access. o Privilege Escalation: Gaining higher privileges than intended due to improper access control configurations. o Directory Traversal: Accessing files outside the intended directory by manipulating file paths. ΓÇó Security Misconfigurations: These vulnerabilities occur when web servers, applications, or databases are misconfigured, exposing unnecessary or insecure functionality. o Unpatched Software: Not applying security updates to web application components. o Default Credentials: Using factory-default usernames and passwords in production environments. o Excessive Permissions: Overly permissive file or folder access permissions on web servers. ΓÇó Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities: These allow attackers to make a web application or website unavailable to legitimate users. o Application-Level DoS: Exploiting application flaws (e.g., resource-intensive processes) to exhaust server resources. o Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): Overloading a server with requests from multiple sources to make it

It falls into three categories, black box, white box, and gray box testing. The life cycle of a pen test typically follows a series of phases designed to mimic the steps an attacker might take to compromise a target. Here's an overview of the pen testing life cycle with the key phases: \n 1. Reconnaissance and Information Gathering The Information gathering phase (reconnaissance) is the initial step in the penetration testing lifecycle. This phase involves collecting as much public information as possible about the organization, systems, networks, applications, and employees to identify potential vulnerabilities and formulate a strategy for further testing. Passive information gathering (reconnaissance) involves collecting data without directly interacting with the target system, reducing the risk of detection. Gathering information from publicly available sources like news outlets, blogs and social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) is named as Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT). The techniques used for OSINT are Web Scraping, Google Dorking, and social media profiling. There are two types of Reconnaissance: ΓÇó Passive Reconnaissance: Gathering information without direct interaction with the target, such as using public sources (websites, social media, WHOIS databases).

Scanning & Vulnerability Analysis Scanning and vulnerability analysis is the second phase of penetration testing whose objective is to discover open ports, services, OS, library versions and other information about the target machine/NW. This information is then used to identify potential vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to the target machine/NW. You can say that in this phase we perform Active Reconnaissance, because the tools used in this phase directly interact with the target network, hosts, ports, employees, and so on to collect data. So DONOT perform active network scanning unless you have written permission of the system owner to perform that testing. Attacker normally perform following activities in this phase: ΓÇó Port Scanning: Identifying open ports and the services running on them. ΓÇó Network Scanning: Mapping the network to identify active devices and their IP addresses. ΓÇó Vulnerability Scanning: Identifying known vulnerabilities in the target's services and applications. Tools: ΓÇó Nmap (https://nmap.org/download) ΓÇó Searchsploit (https://www.exploit-db.com/searchsploit) ΓÇó Nessus (https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus) ΓÇó OpenVAS (https://github.com/greenbone/openvas-scanner) ΓÇó MSF (https://www.metasploit.com/download) ΓÇó Nikto (https://github.com/sullo/nikto) 3. Exploitation and Gaining Initial Access In this phase, the pentester take the advantage of the identified weaknesses like vulnerable applications and default configurations/credentials running on the target machine to gain unauthorized entry into the target system. Other than exploiting the known vulnerabilities, and stolen credentials, the pentester may use brute force, social engineering and phishing attacks to gain the initial entry to the target system. It involves the methods and techniques used by a pentester to gain entry into a target network or system. Attacker normally perform following activities in this phase: ΓÇó Exploiting Vulnerabilities: Using the information gathered to exploit vulnerabilities in services, applications, or network configurations. ΓÇó Brute Force Attacks: Attempting to gain access by guessing passwords or using automated tools to try multiple combinations.

Privilege Escalation After gaining initial access to the target machine, you may find that your session has only limited user rights. This severely limits the actions that one can perform on the remote systems such as dumping passwords, manipulating registry, and installing backdoors or keyloggers. So, Privilege Escalation is a critical phase in penetration testing where the tester attempts to gain elevated access rights beyond initial compromises. Attacker normally perform following activities in this phase: ΓÇó Setuid/Setgid Exploits in Linux: Exploiting binaries with the setuid or setgid bit set, which allows them to run with elevated privileges. ΓÇó Gaining Root Through Sudo Privileges: If the attacker finds that the compromised user has sudo access, they can use it to escalate privileges. ΓÇó Password Hash Dumping: Once an attacker gains access, they can dump password hashes from the system files like /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow on Linux systems. Later they can attempt to crack them offline and may succeed in cracking passwords of higher-privileged accounts. ΓÇó Exploiting Misconfigured Services: Misconfigured services or processes running with elevated privileges may allow attackers to execute code with higher privileges. ΓÇó Exploiting Kernel Vulnerabilities: Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the operating system's kernel to gain system-level or root privileges. Tools: ΓÇó MSF (msfconsole, msfvenom) (https://www.metasploit.com/download) ΓÇó Privilege Escalation Scripts(e.g., powersploit, LinEnum) (https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit) ΓÇó Password Cracking Tools (e.g., John the Ripper, Hashcat) (https://github.com/openwall/john) ΓÇó LinPEAS (Linux Privilege Escalation Awesome Script) (https://github.com/peass-ng/PEASS-ng) 5. Maintaining Access and Persistent Mechanisms Maintaining access and persistent mechanisms are crucial in penetration testing for ensuring that an attacker can retain control over a compromised system and re-access it even after initial detection or remediation efforts. Some common techniques to maintain access are installing a backdoor, keylogger, or a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), create rogue accounts, or modify system configurations to allow re-entry even if the system is rebooted or patched. Attacker normally perform following activities in this phase: ΓÇó Installing Backdoors, rootkits, keyloggers, and reverse shells on target system to maintain access. ΓÇó Uploading web shells, which are malicious scripts that are uploaded on a web server. ΓÇó Creating new user accounts with administrative privileges.

Covering Tracks Covering tracks is important in penetration testing as it demonstrates the methods attackers use to evade detection and hide their activities. To do this the attacker delete or modifies log entries, or do log spoofing (creating false trails). The attacker may also clear command history, perform time stomping, and erase evidence of persistence mechanisms. Attacker normally perform following activities in this phase: ΓÇó Log Clearing: Deleting or modifying system logs to remove traces of the attack. ΓÇó File Removal: Removing any files or tools that were uploaded during the test. ΓÇó Hiding Evidence: Using tools and techniques to conceal the presence of malware or changes made to the system.

Virus A computer virus is a type of malicious software (malware) that infects a computer system and spreads by replicating itself within files or by attaching itself to executable programs. Viruses replicate by inserting their code into other programs or documents. When these infected programs or documents are executed, the virus activates and may further spread to other files on the system. Virus can have following impact on the victims: ΓÇó Data Corruption: Viruses can modify or delete files, leading to data loss and potential damage to critical information. ΓÇó System Instability: Some viruses consume system resources, slowing down or crashing the victim's computer. ΓÇó Privacy Breach: Certain viruses can capture sensitive information such as passwords or credit card details, exposing victims to identity theft. Examples: ΓÇó ILOVEYOU Virus: o Release: May 2000 o Propagation: Spread via email as a love letter with an attachment named "LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.vbs." o Impact: Infected millions of computers worldwide, causing extensive damage by overwriting files and stealing passwords. It forced organizations to shut down their email systems temporarily. o Link: ILOVEYOU virus ΓÇó Melissa Virus: o Release: March 1999 o Propagation: Disseminated via infected Microsoft Word documents attached to emails with enticing subject lines. o Impact: Rapidly spread through email, causing email servers to crash due to the high volume of emails sent. It disrupted email communication globally, incurred high costs. o Link: Melisssa virus 2. Worms A computer worm is a type of malicious software (malware) that, unlike viruses, can self-replicate and spread independently without needing to attach itself to other programs or files. Worms typically exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols or operating systems to propagate quickly across interconnected computers or devices. Key characteristics and behaviors of computer worms are: ΓÇó Self-Replication: Worms can create copies of themselves and spread autonomously to other computers or devices on a network. ΓÇó Network Propagation: They exploit security vulnerabilities in network services or operating systems to spread rapidly across interconnected systems. ΓÇó No Host Attachment: Unlike viruses, worms do not need to attach themselves to executable files or documents to spread.	2398	9	9	[-0.07489697,0.0155737465,0.009283709,-0.011541571,0.07129687,-0.010551422,0.05659404,0.08652306,0.09933133,0.018037325,-0.014005403,0.1399667,0.078713015,-0.057416484,-0.033046536,-0.02511173,-0.032366123,-0.023429392,-0.08228838,0.041539013,0.024392948,-0.017920306,-0.06317431,-0.039288018,-0.07484771,0.04698495,-0.015535913,0.008623913,-0.06730907,-0.02729003,-0.02141218,-0.01794797,0.10677772,0.065287694,-0.07984217,0.024833374,0.049606703,0.024240678,-0.053106207,-0.038444623,0.018445585,0.03285344,0.049198125,0.072699055,0.02893799,0.009887042,-0.019903358,0.0011545678,-0.052113507,-0.029240739,-0.0639193,-0.018639745,0.011339101,0.022507392,-0.06205597,-0.083483055,0.0073688296,-0.027438745,-0.030226987,0.007934719,0.030531876,0.09745877,0.005552053,0.006836202,0.03282585,-0.026092682,0.05399043,0.056738973,0.034306612,0.058347736,-0.0018890717,-0.031090965,-0.08553345,0.11640256,0.047974344,-0.015091116,-0.04673653,0.001144246,0.03468463,0.0086779585,-0.003896653,-0.01860193,0.0727869,-0.010576111,-0.06321053,-0.0071975603,0.039923955,-0.035727073,0.048293483,-0.023299366,-0.021431139,0.02462944,0.12834014,0.030996015,0.03851613,-0.008939995,0.030691428,-0.10426765,0.03054279,0.057193745,-0.04346072,-0.035568632,0.076688915,-0.0045707254,0.04475658,-0.026917525,-0.0043429765,-0.041076064,-0.046058714,-0.057712607,-0.046275757,0.0069996216,-0.061335705,-0.113816805,0.09270584,-0.012639344,-0.083828166,0.037779365,-0.0518852,0.027920714,0.023647074,-0.036872163,0.0252511,-0.044666793,-0.05602625,-0.0895033,-0.025471093,4.2790213e-33,-0.048830345,-0.03163856,-0.05362174,0.04401761,0.04868228,-0.032703612,0.007544325,0.038348503,-0.032807264,0.03648513,0.03191408,-0.0038221974,0.08236924,0.05523761,0.08208723,0.039634395,0.012012456,0.005189575,-0.025394516,-0.006607706,0.14286417,-0.028872015,0.066769525,0.0049947617,0.057035703,-0.06858935,-0.04731489,-0.047228202,0.081229836,-0.012235926,0.010090307,0.064883865,0.0008444896,-0.020057168,-0.026325002,0.03359145,-0.048734024,-0.064293444,0.035712942,0.013455144,0.044337004,0.040392734,0.008296608,-0.018621592,0.05729387,-0.007495453,0.0023793858,0.024506735,-0.02180119,-0.012522553,-0.05038037,0.00022824839,0.06647791,0.02524277,-0.09008998,0.035337918,0.037614178,-0.019366764,0.0043677907,0.02089852,0.049210638,0.010531898,0.03540191,-0.033193585,-0.039035797,-0.14348102,0.13600218,-0.011013944,-0.008291033,0.07757668,-0.022709228,-0.0324564,-0.09252401,-0.0511119,-0.04145819,-0.058473077,-0.03619368,-0.1077084,-0.030329369,0.056481365,-0.12542023,-0.051727057,0.0961494,-0.059951518,-0.10052415,0.06854578,-0.09187462,-0.041351896,-0.040496282,0.051927738,0.078375734,-0.014720784,0.023879528,0.0661329,-0.03188833,-4.813191e-33,-0.088550575,-0.02256319,-0.08986868,0.05715478,-0.019330809,0.061350595,-0.003162909,0.0446699,-0.0397898,-0.045073148,-0.12179485,0.029130954,0.019622969,-0.068376325,0.02335339,0.019336617,0.030515024,0.016170254,-0.08564203,-0.05249102,-0.04921051,0.019957516,-0.036765452,-0.058787666,0.02709704,-0.014605764,0.018742144,0.013519616,0.010244749,0.047686506,0.053899426,0.08725655,-0.03914537,0.12656479,-0.011249239,0.025563233,0.07658029,-0.06110505,0.017918264,-0.0780159,0.045104984,0.11734737,-0.006999014,0.0038919977,0.013115937,0.024161823,-0.048469406,0.096945755,0.08142519,8.51757e-05,0.07137657,-0.049848054,0.034562476,-0.0052392697,-0.025117852,-0.0116197765,-0.0042316834,-0.034340978,-0.013281781,0.04161294,-0.034404952,-0.052521665,-0.039317884,0.028511621,-0.018638901,0.031183533,0.0512483,0.06168628,0.0014224505,-0.08845133,0.05079983,0.06559413,-0.044358063,-0.04687339,-0.057394564,0.008741728,0.047804587,0.003442872,-0.116623834,-0.0014619034,0.038387723,-0.039590236,-0.02817376,-0.021483382,-0.059875786,-0.07111167,0.020167336,0.009976127,0.0043800934,0.025095953,-0.06493579,-0.027938258,-0.029148763,-0.011330965,-0.001293887,-5.0817835e-08,0.02315092,-0.056396108,0.028705066,0.054045133,0.035212245,0.07534983,-0.04424462,0.046470687,0.01669065,0.011216229,0.045777045,-0.019587813,-0.026543515,-0.04442179,0.06918861,0.07999769,-0.036905047,0.037819732,-0.07094162,0.002527755,0.022453444,-0.04083175,-0.0367454,0.013375404,0.048911225,-0.03550442,0.03754598,0.06920105,-0.00376185,-0.0021605606,-0.07529841,-0.021637613,0.014634987,0.027846074,-0.052171607,0.025186215,0.057846762,-0.049334716,0.0035863228,-0.018096041,0.06375651,-0.035833422,0.04717323,0.005690293,-0.039126724,-0.053578082,-0.08333411,-0.06305841,0.0705952,-0.050220463,0.021708004,0.037204,0.020102672,0.10079651,-0.031523418,-0.044790797,0.013061085,-0.0003863813,0.10195412,0.05535276,0.016983887,-0.08254492,0.07550821,-0.024487978,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It also installed back doors on infected systems. o Link: Mydoom 3. Trojan Horse A Trojan horse, often referred to simply as a Trojan is a type of malicious software (malware) that disguises itself as legitimate software or files to deceive users into executing or installing it on their systems. Unlike viruses or worms, Trojans do not self-replicate. Instead, they rely on social engineering tactics to trick users into unwittingly installing them. Here are key characteristics and behaviors of Trojan horses: ΓÇó Disguised as Legitimate Software: Trojans often masquerade as harmless or useful software, files, or documents to trick users into downloading and executing them. ΓÇó No Self-Replication: Unlike viruses and worms, Trojans do not propagate by themselves. They require user interaction to be installed. ΓÇó Malicious Payload: Trojans can carry a wide range of malicious payloads, including backdoors, keyloggers, ransomware, spyware. Examples: ΓÇó Zbot: o Type: Banking Trojan o Impact: Zeus targeted financial institutions, capturing login credentials and financial information from infected systems. o Link: Zbot ΓÇó Remote Access

Ransomware Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to encrypt files on a victim's computer or entire network, rendering them inaccessible until a ransom is paid. It is a form of extortion where attackers demand payment in exchange for decrypting the files and restoring access to the affected system. Here are key characteristics of ransomwares: ΓÇó Encryption: Ransomware encrypts files using strong encryption algorithms, making them unreadable without the decryption key held by the attacker. ΓÇó Ransom Demand: Attackers typically display a ransom note demanding payment (usually in cryptocurrency) in exchange for the decryption key. ΓÇó Propagation: Ransomware can spread through malicious email attachments, compromised websites, or vulnerabilities in software and operating systems. Examples: ΓÇó Ryuk: o Release: August 2018 o Target: Primarily aimed at businesses and large organizations. o Impact: Ryuk encrypts files and demands high ransom payments, often customized based on the victim's perceived ability to pay. It has been linked to financially motivated cybercrime groups and has caused significant financial losses. o Link: Ryuk ΓÇó WannaCry: o Release: May 2017 o Propagation: Exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows known as EternalBlue, which allowed it to spread rapidly across networks. o Impact: WannaCry infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide within days, affecting hospitals, government agencies, and businesses. It encrypted files and demanded ransom payments in Bitcoin. o Link: Wannacry 5. Spyware Spyware is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to secretly gather information about a user's activities on their computer or device without their knowledge or consent. The purpose of spyware ranges from tracking browsing habits for advertising purposes to stealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and personal data. Here are key characteristics and behaviors of spyware: ΓÇó Information Gathering: Spyware monitors and collects various types of information, including keystrokes, personal information, browsing history. ΓÇó Remote Access: Some advanced spyware variants allow attackers to remotely access and control the infected device, enabling them to perform malicious activities discreetly. ΓÇó Data Transmission: Spyware transmits the collected information to remote servers controlled by the attackers or third parties for exploitation or resale.

Adware Adware is a type of software designed to display advertisements on a user's device, often in a disruptive or intrusive manner. While not always malicious, adware can become a significant nuisance, affecting user experience and system performance. Adware is often bundled with free software and gets installed without the user's full awareness or consent. Some characteristics of adware are listed below: ΓÇó Advertisement Display: Adware primarily functions to display advertisements, which can appear as pop-ups, banners, or within the software interface. ΓÇó User Tracking: Many adware programs track user behavior, such as browsing habits, search queries, and site visits, to deliver targeted advertisements. ΓÇó Bundling with Freeware: Adware is commonly bundled with free software downloads, often as part of the installation process, where users may inadvertently agree to install it. Examples: ΓÇó Super fish: o Description: Superfish was an adware program that came pre-installed on some Lenovo laptops. It injected advertisements into web pages viewed by the user. o Impact: Superfish raised significant security concerns because it used a self-signed root certificate to intercept HTTPS traffic, potentially exposing users to man-in-the-middle attacks. o Link: Super fish ΓÇó Crossrider: o Description: Crossrider is a development platform for creating browser extensions and toolbars.

Rootkits A rootkit is a type of malicious software designed to gain unauthorized access to and maintain control over a computer system while hiding its presence from the user and security software. Rootkits achieve this by altering the operating system or other software to mask their activities. They are often used by attackers to maintain long-term control over infected systems, allowing them to execute further malicious activities undetected. Rootkits characteristics are listed below: ΓÇó Stealth and Evasion: Rootkits are highly effective at hiding their presence from users and security tools by concealing their files, processes, and network connections. ΓÇó Persistence: They are designed to survive reboots and persist on the system, providing attackers with continued access. ΓÇó Privilege Escalation: Rootkits often gain root or administrative privileges, allowing them to make significant changes to the system and bypass security mechanisms. Examples: ΓÇó Sony BMG: o Description: In 2005, Sony BMG (Bertelsmann Music Group) included a rootkit as part of its digital rights management (DRM) software on music CDs to prevent unauthorized copying. o Impact: The rootkit was installed without user consent and hid itself deeply within the operating system. It caused significant controversy when it was discovered, as it introduced security vulnerabilities and exposed users to additional malware. o Link: Sony BMG ΓÇó Zero Access Rootkit: o Description: It is a series of php scripts kept on attackerΓÇÖs website. Victim machine gets infected on visiting the website. The malware escalate privileges and gets installed on the system. The malware disables security services and turn the system into a bot. o Impact: Zero Access achieved high levels of stealth and persistence, infecting millions of computers worldwide. It disabled security software and redirected web traffic to generate fraudulent ad clicks. o Link: Zero Access 8. Botnets A botnet is a network of compromised computers, known as "bots" or "zombies," that are controlled remotely by an attacker, often called a "botmaster" or "bot herder." Botnets are typically used to conduct large-scale cyber-attacks and other malicious activities. ΓÇó Remote Control: Botnets allow attackers to control multiple compromised systems from a central point, coordinating their activities for various malicious purposes. ΓÇó Large Scale: Botnets can range in size from a few hundred to millions of infected devices, providing significant computing power and bandwidth to the attacker.

The affected systems were MS Windows 95, 98, Me, 2000, XP, Vista, 7 and 8. It also affected MS Server2003, Server2008, Server2008R2 and Server2012. o Link: Gameover Zeus ΓÇó Exobot: o Description: Exobot is an Android banking trojan that also functions as a botnet, enabling attackers to control infected Android devices. o Impact: Exobot steals banking credentials by overlaying banking apps with fake login screens. It also can intercept SMS messages, allowing attackers to bypass two-factor authentication. o Link: Exobot 9. Fileless Malware Fileless malware is a type of malicious software that does not rely on traditional files to infect a computer. Instead, it exploits existing, legitimate tools and features within the operating system to carry out malicious activities. This makes fileless malware particularly difficult to detect and remove, as it leaves few traces. Some characteristics of fileless malwares are listed below: ΓÇó Leveraging Legitimate Tools: It exploits built-in system tools and utilities, such as PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and other scripting frameworks, to execute malicious activities. ΓÇó Persistence: Fileless malware can achieve persistence by modifying registry settings, scheduling tasks, or exploiting legitimate system processes to restart upon reboot. Examples: ΓÇó PowerGhost: o Description: PowerGhost is a type of fileless malware that primarily targets enterprise networks. It spreads through networks using exploits and weak credentials. o Impact: PowerGhost is used to mine cryptocurrency on infected systems, consuming significant CPU and memory resources, leading to degraded system performance. o Link: PowerGhost ΓÇó Living of the Land: o Description: Living off the land refers to a technique used by attackers where they utilize legitimate tools and processes already present in the operating system to conduct malicious activities. o Impact: By using trusted system tools like PowerShell, WMI, and PsExec, attackers can perform a variety of malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, lateral movement, and command and control operations. o Link:

Use Proxy Chains Description: A proxy chain refers to routing your Internet traffic through multiple proxies in sequence (i.e., chaining proxies). Each proxy server forwards your traffic to the next one in the chain before it reaches the destination. This makes it harder to trace the origin of the traffic because each hop hides the previous one. Proxy chains come pre-installed in Kali Linux and can be configured from the /etc/proxychains.conf file. Pros: ΓÇó Enhanced Anonymity: Routes traffic through multiple proxies, increasing anonymity. ΓÇó Versatility: Can configure different types of proxies in a chain, including public and private proxies. ΓÇó Integration with Tools: Useful for penetration testing tools and anonymizing traffic. Cons: ΓÇó Performance: Can significantly slow down the Internet connection due to multiple hops. ΓÇó Configuration Complexity: Requires careful configuration to ensure all proxies are functioning correctly. ΓÇó Potential Logging: Each proxy in the chain can log traffic, potentially compromising privacy. Installation and Configuring Proxy Chains: $ sudo apt-get install proxychains4 -y $ sudo vim /etc/proxychains4.conf Just go through the above configuration file. At the very top you can find the types of proxies like http, socks4, socks5, and so on (Do read about these). In above configuration file remove the hash symbol before dynamic_chain and comment the strict_chain and at the very bottom of the file just add a new line that will add socks5 support socks5 127.0.0.1 9050 $ curl icanhazip.com 139.135.32.190 $ proxychains curl icanhazip.com 185.220.101.37 If proxychains do not work, you may need to start the tor service using systemctl command.

Use Virtual Private Network (VPN) Service \n Description: A VPN server encrypts the userΓÇÖs Internet traffic and routes it through a remote server, masking the userΓÇÖs IP address and providing a secure connection. Moreover, it works at OS level and changes the IP address of all NW applications. There exist free as well as paid services like OpenVPN and ProtonVPN respectively. VPNs are widely used for enhancing privacy, security, and bypassing geo-restrictions. Links for some free proxy services that you can use are given below: https://protonvpn.com/ https://www.tunnelbear.com/ Pros: ΓÇó Strong Encryption: Provides secure, encrypted connections, protecting data from interception. ΓÇó Privacy: Masks the userΓÇÖs IP address, making it difficult to track online activities. ΓÇó Bypass Geo-restrictions and Censorship: Allows access to geo-blocked content and services. Cons: ΓÇó Trust in Provider: Users must trust the VPN provider not to log or misuse their data. ΓÇó Cost: High-quality VPN services typically require a subscription fee. ΓÇó Speed Reduction: Encryption and routing through remote servers can reduce connection speeds.

Use Tor Browser (The Onion Router) https://www.torproject.org/ \n Description: The Onion Router (TOR) is privacy focused web browser that routes your Internet traffic through multiple volunteer-operated servers (nodes) across the globe to anonymize your online activity. The data is sent through at least three nodes. The Entry node, which knows your IP but not your destination. The Middle node passes encrypted data. The Exit node decrypts the final layer and sends the request to destination website, which sees the Exit nodeΓÇÖs IP address and not yours. The TOR browser is used to access all the .onion websites and the deep web. Pros: ΓÇó Strong Anonymity: Traffic is encrypted and routed through multiple nodes, thus making your traffic anonymous on the Internet and difficult to trace. ΓÇó Access to .onion Sites: Enables access to hidden services and websites on the dark web. ΓÇó Censorship Resistance: Helps bypass Internet censorship and restrictions. Cons: ΓÇó Performance: Can be slow due to multiple layers of encryption and routing. ΓÇó Blocked Sites: Some websites block traffic from Tor nodes. ΓÇó Reputation: Associated with illegal activities on the dark web, although it also supports legitimate uses. Installation and using Tor Browser: $ sudo apt update $ sudo apt-get install tor torbrowser-launcher $ sudo systemctl status/start/restart/stop tor $ torbrowser-launcher ΓÇó The last command will launch your Tor browser, and for the first time it may take a while. Once you see the GUI of Tor browser, the next step is to verify that the tor service is running on your OS. For this just type the following address inside the address bar of the Tor browser https://torbrowser.project.org ΓÇó Once the index page is displayed, it will display the public IP through which your browser is connected to the Internet, which will be different from the public IP of your Linux machine and you can confirm this by checking your public IP in another browser tab by typing what is my ip OR by visiting https://www.dnsleaktest.com/ ΓÇó Please make time and open the settings of Tor browser, especially Privacy & Security settings, and over there specially the Security Level that can be set to Standard/Safer/Safest.

TOR Browser + VPN \n Description: Combining TOR with a VPN provides an additional layer of security and privacy. Users connect to a VPN before accessing the Tor network, adding an extra hop between their device and the Tor entry node. Pros: ΓÇó Enhanced Privacy: Encrypts traffic through both the VPN and Tor network, providing strong anonymity. ΓÇó Hidden Tor Usage: VPN hides the use of Tor from the ISP, adding an extra layer of obfuscation. ΓÇó Security: Provides defense-in-depth by combining the benefits of both technologies. Cons: ΓÇó Significant Speed Reduction: Can be very slow due to double encryption and multiple hops. ΓÇó Complexity: More complex to set up and manage compared to using either technology alone. ΓÇó Cost: Requires a VPN subscription in addition to using Tor. Note: You can use a layered approach by using TOR + VPN + ProxyChains 8. Use a Persistent USB Containing Portable OS Description: Using a USB drive with a portable operating system (such as Tails https://tails.net/ or Whonix https://www.whonix.org/ ) allows users to boot in a secure, isolated environment that leaves no trace on the host machine. This method is ideal for maintaining high levels of privacy and security as these OSs use layered approach by using TOR+VPN+ProxyChains. Pros: ΓÇó High Level of Anonymity: Does not leave any traces on the host computer, ensuring complete privacy. ΓÇó Portable: Can be used on any compatible computer, providing a consistent and secure environment. ΓÇó Pre-configured Tools: Often includes pre-configured privacy and security tools, such as Tor and secure communication software. Cons: ΓÇó Convenience: Requires carrying and securely storing the USB drive. ΓÇó Compatibility Issues: May not work seamlessly with all hardware configurations. ΓÇó Learning Curve: May require users to learn and adapt to a different operating system and
